## NPSP Opportunities Example

# To run this code against an org called 'qa':
#
# cci task run generate_and_load_from_yaml -o generator_yaml examples/npsp/Opportunity_npsp.recipe.yml -o num_records 300 -o num_records_tablename Opportunity --org qa
#
# Look at examples/salesforce/Opportunity.recipe.yml for non-NPSP examples.

- include_file: ../salesforce/standard_objs.recipe.yml #this defines standard objects for reference in later sections
- include_file: standard_npsp_objs_recipe.yml #this defines simple custom objects in the NPSP architecture (referenced later)

#This is a "template" version of an Opportunity definition.  You may want to copy it and create iterations for various Record Types/use cases.  Sample fields and random options are included in the longer definition of a more complex Opportunity below.  If you are running this in a Salesforce environment, your data will be subject to validation rules.
