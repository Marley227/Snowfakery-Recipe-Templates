# Snowdockery

This is a proof-of-concept level project to try to get [CumulusCI](https://github.com/SFDO-Tooling/CumulusC), [Snowfakery](https://github.com/SFDO-Tooling/Snowfakery), and a [web-UI](https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/DataGenerationToolkit/tree/master/proofs-of-concept/SnowmakeryEditor) (A proof-of-concept level project itself) all running in a Docker container. Originally developed by [Aaron Crosman](https://github.com/acrosman/snowdockery), the expectation is to use this as a jumping off point for a more complete and useful solution.

1. `docker build .`
1. `docker run`
